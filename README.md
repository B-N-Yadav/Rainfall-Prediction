** Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning**

A machine learning project that predicts rainfall based on meteorological features like temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed.

 Overview
This notebook ("Rainfall_Prediction_update.ipynb") demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model training using ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix  

##  Dataset
The dataset contains weather parameters such as:
- Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Wind Speed, and Rainfall  
You can use any public dataset (e.g., Kaggle Weather Dataset or IMD data).

##  Requirements
'''bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
p install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### Usage
Open the notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Rainfall_Prediction_update.ipynb
Run the cells to train and test the model.

View accuracy results and rainfall predictions.

### Future Scope
Use deep learning models for time-series rainfall prediction.

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask.
